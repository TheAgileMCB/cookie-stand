The home of Pat's fresh-baked salmon cookies!

Pat's Salmon Cookies is a project designed to flex our use of JavaScript constructor functions and our commande of HTML organization and CSS styling.

Some base numbers exist, but I have also written scripts to allow for HTML form submissions to dynamically populate a table. The landing page style is salmon-inspired and loaded with photos. The sales page accepts form input and calculates sales averages abd populates the table that lives on that page with the information supplied.

The additional store contacts at the bottom of the page link to faux "under construction" web pages (for a little more authenticity).

Thanks for checking it out!
